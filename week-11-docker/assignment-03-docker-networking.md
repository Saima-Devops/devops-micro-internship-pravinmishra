# Assignment 3 — Docker Networking

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will explore Docker networking by using default bridge, custom bridge, multiple bridge, and host network modes. You will verify container communication, service discovery, network isolation, public access, and host networking on a Linux VM or EC2 instance.

# Task 1 — Deploy a Standalone Application Using the Default Bridge Network

## Goal

Deploy an Nginx web server using Docker’s default bridge network and access it through the VM public IP address.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Available Docker Networks

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker network ls
```

The output must include the default `bridge`, `host`, and `none` networks.

# Task 2 — Connect Containers Using a Custom Bridge Network

## Goal

Create a custom bridge network and verify that containers can communicate using container names rather than IP addresses.

### Evidence

```bash
docker network ls
```

#### Screenshot 7 — Service Discovery by Container Name

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful output from:

```bash
docker exec -it frontend curl backend
```

#### Screenshot 8 — Custom Network Inspection

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker network inspect mynetwork
```

The output must show both `frontend` and `backend` connected to `mynetwork`.

# Task 3 — Demonstrate Multi-Network Isolation

## Goal

Deploy frontend, backend, and database containers across two separate Docker networks. Verify allowed communication and confirm that the frontend cannot directly reach the database.

### Evidence

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker network ls

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker ps
```

The output must show:

- `frontend` with the published port mapping `0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp`
- `backend` without a published host port
- `db` without a published host port

![alt text](screenshots/Assignment-03/Screenshot-10.png)

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Frontend Network Inspection

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker network inspect frontend-network
```

The output must show `frontend` and `backend`.

![alt text](screenshots/Assignment-03/Screenshot-11.png)

---

#### Screenshot 12 — Backend Network Inspection

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker network inspect backend-network
```

The output must show `backend` and `db`.

![alt text](screenshots/Assignment-03/Screenshot-12.png)

---

#### Screenshot 13 — Frontend-to-Backend Communication

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful output from:

```bash
docker exec frontend wget -qO- http://backend
```

The output must display the Nginx Welcome Page HTML.

![alt text](screenshots/Assignment-03/Screenshot-13.png)

---

#### Screenshot 14 — Backend-to-Database Communication

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing a successful connection to `db` on port `27017` from the `backend` container.

![alt text](screenshots/Assignment-03/Screenshot-15.png)

---

#### Screenshot 15 — Frontend-to-Database Isolation

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing that the `frontend` container cannot reach `db` on port `27017`.

The output must include:

```text
Expected result: frontend cannot reach db
```

![alt text](screenshots/Assignment-03/Screenshot-16.png)

---

#### Screenshot 16 — Public Frontend Access

Add a browser screenshot showing the Nginx Welcome Page from the `frontend` container at:

```text
http://<YOUR-VM-PUBLIC-IP>
```

Ensure that the VM public IP is visible in the address bar. Add your full name as a clear caption directly below the screenshot.

# Task 4 — Deploy an Application Using Docker Host Network Mode

# Networking Notes

Write a short note explaining:

- Default bridge networking
- Container-name communication on a custom bridge network
- Why the frontend could not access the database in Task 3
- The difference between bridge mode and host network mode


1. **Default bridge networking:** Containers without a specified network join Docker’s default bridge. They can communicate by IP address, but automatic container-name resolution is not provided.

2. **Custom bridge networking:** Containers on the same user-defined bridge network can communicate using container names and internal ports, such as api:3000 or db:27017.

3. **Frontend-to-database isolation:** In Task 3, ui joined only frontend-network, while db joined only backend-network. Because they did not share a network, the frontend could not reach the database. The backend joined both networks to communicate with each.

4. **Bridge versus host mode:** Bridge mode gives containers separate network interfaces and uses port publishing (-p) for host access. On Linux, host mode shares the host’s network namespace, so the app uses host ports directly, port publishing is unnecessary, and network isolation is reduced.
