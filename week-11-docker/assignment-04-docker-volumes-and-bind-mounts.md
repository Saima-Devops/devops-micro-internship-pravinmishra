# Assignment 4 — Docker Volumes and Bind Mounts

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will use Docker Bind Mounts and Docker Volumes to persist logs and application data outside a container’s lifecycle. You will verify that data remains available after containers are removed and recreated.

---

# Task 1 — Persist Nginx Logs Using a Bind Mount

## Goal

Deploy an Nginx container with a Bind Mount and verify that its log files remain on the VM host after the container is removed.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Nginx Image Pull

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful completion of:

```bash
docker pull nginx:alpine
```

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Host Log Directory

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing the created host directory:

```text
$HOME/nginx-logs
```
![alt text](screenshots/Assignment-04/Screenshot-2.png)

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Running Nginx Container with Port Mapping

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker ps
```

The output must show the `myweb` container with:

```text
0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp
```

![alt text](screenshots/Assignment-04/Screenshot-3.png)

---

#### Screenshot 4 — Nginx Welcome Page

Add a browser screenshot showing the Nginx Welcome Page at:

```text
http://<YOUR-VM-PUBLIC-IP>
```

Ensure that the VM public IP is visible in the address bar. Add your full name as a clear caption directly below the screenshot.

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Bind-Mounted Log Files

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing the host log files and access-log content from:

```text
$HOME/nginx-logs
```

The output must show `access.log`, `error.log`, and an access-log entry created when you opened the Nginx page.

---

#### Screenshot 6 — Nginx Container Removed

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful completion of:

```bash
docker stop myweb
docker rm myweb
```

![alt text](screenshots/Assignment-04/Screenshot-6.png)

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Logs Persist After Container Removal

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing that `access.log` and `error.log` still exist in:

```text
$HOME/nginx-logs
```

The access log must retain its content after the container has been removed.

# Task 2 — Share Persistent Data Using a Docker Volume

## Goal

Deploy backend and frontend containers that share data through a named Docker Volume. Verify that the data remains after both containers are removed and recreated.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — Project File Structure

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing the `two-tier-app` project structure, including separate `backend` and `frontend` directories with a `Dockerfile` and `index.js` file in each.

![alt text](screenshots/Assignment-04/Screenshot-8.png)

---

#### Screenshot 9 — Custom Docker Network

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing `mynetwork` in:

```bash
docker network ls
```

![alt text](screenshots/Assignment-04/Screenshot-9.png)

---

#### Screenshot 10 — Docker Volume

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing `shared-data` in:

```bash
docker volume ls
```

![alt text](screenshots/Assignment-04/Screenshot-10.png)

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Backend Dockerfile

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing the completed backend `Dockerfile`.

![alt text](screenshots/Assignment-04/Screenshot-11.png)

---

#### Screenshot 12 — Backend Image Build

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful completion of the `backend-app:latest` image build.

![alt text](screenshots/Assignment-04/Screenshot-13.png)

---

#### Screenshot 13 — Running Backend Container

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker ps
```

The output must show the running `backend` container.

![alt text](screenshots/Assignment-04/Screenshot-12.png)

---

#### Screenshot 14 — Frontend Dockerfile

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing the completed frontend `Dockerfile`.

![alt text](screenshots/Assignment-04/Screenshot-14.png)

---

#### Screenshot 15 — Frontend Image Build

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful completion of the `frontend-app:latest` image build.

![alt text](screenshots/Assignment-04/Screenshot-15.png)

---

#### Screenshot 16 — Running Backend and Frontend Containers

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker ps
```

The output must show both `backend` and `frontend` containers running. Only `frontend` must have the published port mapping:

```text
0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp
```

![alt text](screenshots/Assignment-04/Screenshot-16.png)

---

#### Screenshot 17 — Backend Write Operation

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing a successful backend write operation to the shared Docker Volume.

The output must include:

```text
Data written: Hello from Backend!
```

![alt text](screenshots/Assignment-04/Screenshot-17.png)

---

#### Screenshot 18 — Frontend Reads Shared Data

Add a browser screenshot showing:

```text
Hello from Backend!
```

Add your full name as a clear caption directly below the screenshot.

![alt text](screenshots/Assignment-04/Screenshot-18.png)

---

#### Screenshot 19 — First Shared-Data Update

Add a browser screenshot showing:

```text
Test Data 1
```

Add your full name as a clear caption directly below the screenshot.

![alt text](screenshots/Assignment-04/Screenshot-19.png)

---

#### Screenshot 20 — Second Shared-Data Update

Add a browser screenshot showing:

```text
Test Data 2 - New Update
```

Add your full name as a clear caption directly below the screenshot.

![Full name: Saima Usman](screenshots/Assignment-04/Screenshot-20.png)

![Full name: Saima Usman](screenshots/Assignment-04/Screenshot-21.png)

Full name: Saima Usman

#### Screenshot 21 — Container Removal and Recreation

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing the `frontend` and `backend` containers removed and recreated using the same `shared-data` Docker Volume.

![Full name: Saima Usman](screenshots/Assignment-04/Screenshot-22.png)
Full name: Saima Usman

---

#### Screenshot 22 — Data Persists After Recreation

Add a browser screenshot showing:

```text
Test Data 2 - New Update
```

This proves that the `shared-data` Docker Volume outlived both application containers.

Add your full name as a clear caption directly below the screenshot.

# Storage Persistence Notes

Write a short explanation covering:

- The difference between a Bind Mount and a Docker Volume
- How Task 1 proved Bind Mount persistence
- How Task 2 proved Docker Volume persistence
- Why Docker Volumes are commonly used for application data

### My Explanation:

A **Bind Mount** connects a specific file or directory on the host to a container, while a **Docker Volume** stores data in a location managed by Docker.

**Task 1** demonstrated Bind Mount persistence by showing that the saved data remained in the host directory after the container was removed and was accessible when mounted into a new container. **Task 2** demonstrated Docker Volume persistence by recreating the container with the same volume and confirming that the previously saved data was still available.

Docker Volumes are commonly used for application data because they keep storage independent of the container’s lifecycle, simplify storage management, and allow replacement containers to reuse existing data. The data remains until the volume itself is deleted.
