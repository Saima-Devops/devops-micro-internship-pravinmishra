# Assignment 4 — Deploy EpicBook on Ubuntu VM + MySQL RDS with Secure Cloud Network

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will deploy the EpicBook web application in AWS using a secure two-tier architecture: an Ubuntu EC2 instance with Nginx in a public subnet, and a private MySQL RDS database with restricted security-group access. The completed deployment must prove that the frontend, backend, and private database communicate successfully end to end.

```
Internet → Nginx/EC2 (public subnet) → Node.js backend → MySQL RDS (private subnet)
```

# Task 1 — Create VPC + Public/Private Subnets + Routing

## Goal

Create `epicbook-vpc` (10.0.0.0/16) with a public subnet (10.0.1.0/24) and a private subnet (10.0.2.0/24), attach an Internet Gateway, and route only the public subnet to it.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — VPC details showing CIDR 10.0.0.0/16

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Route table showing 0.0.0.0/0 → IGW and association with the public subnet

---

# Task 2 — Create Security Groups (EC2 + RDS) with Least Privilege

## Goal

Create `epicbook-ec2-sg` (SSH from your IP, HTTP/HTTPS public) and `epicbook-rds-sg` (MySQL 3306 only from `epicbook-ec2-sg`).

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — EC2 security-group inbound rules showing ports and sources

![alt text](screenshots/week06-assnmnt-04-04.png)

---

#### Screenshot 5 — RDS security-group inbound rule showing MySQL 3306 allowed from the EC2 security group

---

# Task 3 — Launch Ubuntu EC2 in Public Subnet

## Goal

Launch an Ubuntu 20.04 instance in the public subnet with `epicbook-ec2-sg` attached, and connect to it over SSH.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — EC2 instance summary showing the public IPv4 address, subnet, and security group

![alt text](screenshots/week06-assnmnt-04-06.png)

---

# Task 4 — Install Required Software on EC2

## Goal

Install Node.js, npm, Nginx, and the MySQL client on the instance, and confirm Nginx is running.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — Output of `node -v` and `npm -v`

![alt text](screenshots/week06-assnmnt-04-09.png)

---

#### Screenshot 9 — Output of `systemctl status nginx`

# Task 5 — Create RDS MySQL in Private Subnet (No Public Access)

## Goal

Create a private MySQL RDS instance in `epicbook-vpc` using a DB Subnet Group over the private subnet, with `epicbook-rds-sg` attached and public access disabled.

### Evidence

# Task 8 — Serve Frontend Using Nginx + Reverse Proxy to Backend

## Goal

Copy the frontend files to the Nginx web root and configure Nginx to reverse-proxy `/api/` to the Node backend.

### Evidence

> `Nginx remains the public-facing web server/reverse proxy, while Express handles the dynamic EpicBook application.`


---

# Task 9 — End-to-End Testing (Frontend ↔ Backend ↔ RDS)

## Goal

Verify the frontend loads publicly, the backend responds through Nginx, and EC2 can query the private RDS database.

### Evidence

![alt text](screenshots/week06-assnmnt-04-25.png)

---

#### Screenshot 20 — Terminal showing a successful API call through the public endpoint, such as `curl http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>/api/...`
